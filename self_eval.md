1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
* I feel confident with them.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
* I spent about 2 hours on it. I don't have a detailed estimate, but I'm realizing now that I need to updatemy calendar for the rest of the week.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
* I didn't realize until I did my pairing exercise that I somehow missed the lesson on running Ruby code from Atom in the Terminal. I'm not sure where this was.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
* Still not clear on when to use "puts" and when not to. Difference between Atom and IRB is unclear to me.
